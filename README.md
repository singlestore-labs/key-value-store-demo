======================================

**Attention**: The code in this repository is intended for experimental use only and is not fully tested, documented, or supported by SingleStore. Visit the [SingleStore Forums](https://www.singlestore.com/forum/) to ask questions about this repository.

Whether you're using an ORM or straight SQL, you can get started with [SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/) (formerly MemSQL) fast. Here's an introductory sample of using SingleStore with Node and JavaScript. This sample includes all the CRUD methods: Create, Read by id, Read all, Update, and Delete.

This is the demo code to accompany this blog post: [How to Use SingleStore and Node](TBD).


## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- Before you begin, you will need a FREE SingleStore account. You can learn more about creating an SingleStore account in the [SingleStore Getting Started](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/getting-started-with-managed-service/sign-up-for-managed-service.html) documentation.


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone example repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:singlestore-labs/key-value-store-demo.git
cd key-value-store-demo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Update DB Config

In `index.js` be sure to change the connection details at the top of the file to match the connection details from your SingleStore Database

```javascript
// index.js

// TODO: adjust these connection details to match your SingleStore deployment:
const HOST = 'PASTE YOUR SINGLESTORE ADMIN ENDPOINT HERE';
const USER = 'admin';
const PASSWORD = 'PASTE YOUR PASSWORD HERE';
const DATABASE = "app";
```

### 4. Run the development server

```sh
npm start
```
